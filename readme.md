Step 1: Prepare Dependencies on an Online Machine

You’ll first use a machine with internet access to download all required dependencies and set up a portable local repository.
1.1 Set Up the Project

Assuming you’ve already created the project as outlined earlier, use the pom.xml from my previous response (with Spring Web and Spring Security dependencies).
1.2 Download All Dependencies

On the online machine, in the website-backend directory:
bash
mvn dependency:resolve

    This downloads all dependencies specified in pom.xml to your local Maven repository (default: ~/.m2/repository).
    It also caches them locally.

To ensure all transitive dependencies (including Spring Boot’s dependencies) are included, also run:
bash
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

    This copies all dependencies to target/dependency/ in your project folder.

1.3 Create a Local Repository Snapshot

    Your local Maven repository is at ~/.m2/repository (e.g., C:\Users\YourName\.m2\repository on Windows or /home/yourname/.m2/repository on Linux/macOS).
    This folder contains all the JARs, POMs, and metadata for Spring Boot, Spring Security, and their dependencies.

1.4 Verify the Project Builds

Build the project to ensure everything is cached:
bash
mvn clean package

    This creates target/website-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
    If this works, all necessary dependencies are in ~/.m2/repository.

Step 2: Transfer to the Offline Machine
2.1 Gather Files

Copy these to a USB drive or similar:

    Project Folder: The entire website-backend directory (includes pom.xml, src/, and target/ if built).
    Local Maven Repository: The ~/.m2/repository folder from the online machine.
    Maven Installation: Download Apache Maven (e.g., apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip) from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi and include it.
    Java: The JDK folder (e.g., jdk-17) if not already on the offline machine.

2.2 Place Files on Offline Machine

    Example structure on the offline machine:
    text

    /offline-setup/
    ├── website-backend/           # Your project folder
    ├── maven/                     # Maven installation (e.g., apache-maven-3.9.6)
    ├── jdk-17/                    # Java installation
    ├── local-maven-repo/          # Copied ~/.m2/repository

Step 3: Configure the Offline Machine
3.1 Set Up Java

    Place jdk-17/ in a convenient location (e.g., C:\jdk-17).
    Set environment variables:
        Windows:
        cmd

set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk-17
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
Linux/macOS:
bash

        export JAVA_HOME=/offline-setup/jdk-17
        export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    Verify: java -version

3.2 Set Up Maven

    Extract maven/ (e.g., to C:\maven or /offline-setup/maven).
    Set environment variables:
        Windows:
        cmd

set MAVEN_HOME=C:\maven
set PATH=%MAVEN_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
Linux/macOS:
bash

        export MAVEN_HOME=/offline-setup/maven
        export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
    Verify: mvn -version

3.3 Configure Maven to Use Local Repository

    Copy local-maven-repo/ to a location on the offline machine (e.g., C:\local-maven-repo or /offline-setup/local-maven-repo).
    Tell Maven to use this local repository instead of the default ~/.m2/repository:
        Option 1: Edit Maven Settings
            Open MAVEN_HOME/conf/settings.xml (or create ~/.m2/settings.xml if it doesn’t exist).
            Add or modify the <localRepository> tag:
            xml

    <settings>
        <localRepository>C:/local-maven-repo</localRepository>
        <!-- Or /offline-setup/local-maven-repo on Linux/macOS -->
        <offline>true</offline> <!-- Forces offline mode -->
    </settings>

Option 2: Command-Line Flag

    Use the -Dmaven.repo.local flag when running Maven commands (no need to edit settings):
    bash

            mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/offline-setup/local-maven-repo clean package
    Set Maven to offline mode permanently (optional):
        Edit settings.xml to include <offline>true</offline> (as shown above).
        Or use the -o flag: mvn -o clean package.

Step 4: Build, Test, and Deploy Offline
4.1 Build the Project

In the website-backend directory:
bash
mvn -o clean package

    The -o flag ensures Maven doesn’t try to connect online.
    If configured in settings.xml, you can just run mvn clean package.
    Output: target/website-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.

4.2 Test the Application

Run the JAR:
bash
java -jar target/website-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

    Server starts at http://localhost:8080.
    Test the login endpoint (if curl is available):
    bash

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"secret123"}'
    Expected: "Login successful".

4.3 Deploy Locally

Since it’s a Spring Boot app with an embedded Tomcat server, “deploying” just means running the JAR. Keep it running for your localhost server:
bash
java -jar target/website-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

    Access it at http://localhost:8080 from a browser or client on the same machine.

Step 5: Troubleshooting Offline

    Missing Dependencies: If mvn package fails with missing artifacts:
        On the online machine, add the missing dependency to pom.xml, run mvn dependency:resolve, and recopy ~/.m2/repository.
    Maven Errors: Ensure the local repository path matches what’s in settings.xml or the command-line flag.
    Java Version: Verify the offline machine’s Java version matches the project (Java 17+).

Connecting to Your Original Question

Your ConfigCallbackHandler was JAAS-based, but we’ve adapted it into a Spring Boot REST service (AuthService/AuthController). The offline setup doesn’t need JAAS callbacks since it’s now a web backend accepting HTTP requests. All Spring dependencies are now local, so Maven can build it without internet access.
Next Steps

    Frontend: Add a local HTML/JS page to interact with the backend offline (I can help with this).
    Database: Integrate an embedded database like H2 (self-contained, no internet needed) instead of hardcoded credentials.
    Enhancements: Add more endpoints or features as needed.

Let me know if you need help with any specific part of this process (e.g., transferring files, testing offline, or adding a frontend)!
